    "My first capability is to rank stepcharts on a very fine scale. To understand what is going on, I should explain what I do in more detail. The only exciting addition used in this document is a machine-learning model. Specifically, this model takes as input a chart and produces as output a real number like 72.1579352. This number has no inherent meaning, except that I consider a chart more difficult than another chart if this number is higher for one than the other. Now to visualize this, tell me where I can find some charts on your system. I will assign each of them a real number and then order, or rank, them into a long list from easiest to hardest. Depending on how many charts are contained in the directory you point me at, this might take a while, so I will only evaluate the first 1000 unless you comment out a line below."

I will use these by looking for a chart and its real value for which the smallest threshold is still larger than that number and assign the corresponding label to that threshold.

    "Now, this may confuse you. However, don't worry. I'm here to help. Probably some of your packs produce long, uniformly colored lines, and you are wondering why a 1 in one pack would be a 9 in another. Well, if you see long lines at the start or end of one pack, that is likely because that pack contains only some difficulties. Take, for instance, the pack BemaniBeats. This pack only includes difficulties 9-13, with an odd 420. How should I determine how difficulties 1-8 should be defined if they are absent? Exactly, I can't. So instead, I assume anything easier than the easiest chart in a pack should get the same label as that easiest chart, which in some cases might be a 9. The same holds for the opposite end of a pack, by the way.\n",

    "## Visualizing Pack-Ranking Agreement\n",

    "How about evaluating how strongly packs agree with my ranking? Using the optimal thresholds, I can assign each chart a new block difficulty, which can then be compared to its old one. The typical way to compare multiple of these is a confusion matrix. Which I do below for all the packs."
